4. Go to your web service
5. Click on "Variables"
6. Add a new variable:
   - Name: `DATABASE_URL`
   - Value: Paste the PostgreSQL connection URL

### 4. Set Up Additional Environment Variables

Add these environment variables in the "Variables" section of your web service:
- `FLASK_ENV`: production
- `FLASK_CONFIG`: production
- `SECRET_KEY`: [generate a secure random string]
- `JWT_SECRET_KEY`: [generate another secure random string]

### 5. Access Your Application

## Troubleshooting

### Database Issues

If you encounter database issues:

2. Verify that the DATABASE_URL environment variable is correct
3. You may need to manually run `python init_db.py` if the database isn't initialized

### Missing Functionality

If certain features are missing:
1. Check that all required environment variables are set
2. Verify that the database was properly initialized
3. Check the logs for any errors during deployment

### Performance Issues
